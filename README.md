## PasswordGenerator
The purpose of this assignment is to generate a password that contains random upper case, lower case letters, special characters, and/or numerical characters. We are provided with js file that needs to fill in with code to make a unique password everytime we click generate password. The Html and style.css did not need to be modified.

## Website Screenshot
This is what the website needs to look like after fixing the starter js file.
